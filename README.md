# Techtok ID Backend Application

Techtok ID is a gadget e-commerce store. Initially this project was built for my final project assignment at Purwadhika Digital School using JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js.

To utilize my new learnt skill and enhance the security of the application, I re-create the backend application using Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.
